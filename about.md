The Compendium Global is a curated repository of specialized techniques, designed for students, educators, and professionals across various academic fields.

<h2>Mission</h2>

Our goal is to distill complex strategies into rapid, review-ready notes. We focus on:

- **Efficiency:** Techniques that save critical time and mental effort.
- **Clarity:** Step-by-step breakdowns of non-intuitive patterns.
- **Rigor:** Maintaining precision while prioritizing practical execution.

<h2>Participation</h2>

We welcome contributions from the community. If you have a technique or a set of notes you'd like to share, follow the academic structure of this project.

<h3>How to Contribute</h3>

1. **Repository Hub:** [Fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/thekunalprashant/math-compendium/fork)
2. **Standard Format:** Add your topic directory in the appropriate subject folder (e.g., `/subjects/math/your-topic-name/index.md`)
3. **Review Process:** Submit a Pull Request for peer review.

<h3>Standard Topic Template</h3>

To maintain a professional aesthetic, please use the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
layout: page
title: Your Topic Name
description: A concise summary of the method
category: Algebraic Manipulation # Optional, defaults to Miscellaneous
popular: true                 # Optional
---
```

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

- **Precision:** Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$.
- **Structure:** Always include a core principle followed by categorized examples.
- **Focus:** Keep explanations competition-focused (optimized for speed and intuition).
- **Automated Dating:** You don't need to specify a date; the system automatically uses the date your topic is published.
